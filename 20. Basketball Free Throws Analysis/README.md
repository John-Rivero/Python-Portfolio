# Scenario

This project aims to analyze and visualize the performance of basketball players in terms of free throws and free throw attempts per game. The analysis will be done using the Python programming language. The data for two additional in-game statistics, i.e., Free Throws and Free Throw Attempts, has been provided in the form of vectors.

The project requires the creation of two matrices, which will be used for the analysis. The first matrix will contain the free throw attempts per game for each player, while the second matrix will contain the accuracy of free throws for each player. From these matrices, three different plots will be created to portray the following insights:

Free Throw Attempts per Game: This plot will show the average number of free throw attempts per game for each player. This plot will help in identifying the players who attempt the most free throws per game.

Accuracy of Free Throws: This plot will show the accuracy of free throws for each player. This plot will help in identifying the players who have the highest accuracy when it comes to free throws.

Player Playing Style (2 vs 3 points preference): This plot will show the preference of each player for 2-point shots vs. 3-point shots, excluding free throws. This plot will help in identifying the players who prefer one type of shot over the other.

The project will provide useful insights for coaches, analysts, and basketball enthusiasts who are interested in understanding the performance of players in terms of free throws and shots.
